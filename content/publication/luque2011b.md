# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "It is widely assumed that the cerebellum is one of the main nervous centers involved in correcting and refining planned movement and accounting for disturbances occurring during movement, for instance, due to the manipulation of objects which affect the kinematics and dynamics of the robot-arm plant model. In this brief, we evaluate a way in which a cerebellarlike structure can store a model in the granular and molecular layers. Furthermore, we study how its microstructure and input representations (context labels and sensorimotor signals) can efficiently support model abstraction toward delivering accurate corrective torque values for increasing precision during differentobject manipulation. We also describe how the explicit (objectrelated input labels) and implicit state input representations (sensorimotor signals) complement each other to better handle different models and allow interpolation between two already stored models. This facilitates accurate corrections during manipulations of new objects taking advantage of already stored models."
